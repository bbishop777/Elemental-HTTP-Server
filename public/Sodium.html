  <h1>Sodium</h1><h2>Na</h2><h3>Atomic number 11</h3><p>Sodium /ˈsoʊdiəm/[4] is a chemical element with symbol Na (from Ancient Greek Νάτριο) and atomic number 11. It is a soft, silver-white, highly reactive metal. In the Periodic table it is in column 1 (alkali metals), and shares with the other six elements in that column that it has a single electron in its outer shell, which it readily donates, creating a positively charged atom - a cation. Its only stable isotope is 23Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but instead must be prepared from its compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). Phase: solid.  Melting point: 370.944 K ​(97.794 °C, ​208.029 °F).  Boiling point 1156.090 K ​(882.940 °C, ​1621.292 °F).  Density near r.t.: 0.968 g/cm3.  When liquid, at m.p.: 0.927 g/cm3.  Critical point: 2573 K, 35 MPa (extrapolated).  Heat of fusion: 2.60 kJ/mol.  Heat of vaporization: 97.42 kJ/mol.  Molar heat capacity: 28.230 J/(mol·K).</p>
